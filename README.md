# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's course "Getting and Cleaning data", on Coursera.
The dataset used: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
The working directory is called "UCI HAR Dataset" 

# Summary description of the project instructions:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Files to explore:
a) CodeBook.md  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
b) run_analysis.R  contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 
c) The output of the 5th step is called  ProfCubetidy.txt.
